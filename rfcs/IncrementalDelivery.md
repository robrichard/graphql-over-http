# Incremental Delivery over HTTP

This RFC proposes adding a specification of how "Incremental" GraphQL results should be delivered to clients, using HTTP chunked transfer encoding.

## Incremental Results

An Incremental result is a GraphQL result that is split up into multiple payloads, allowing clients quicker access to parts of the results. Currently this is supported by the proposed `@defer` and `@stream` directives ([RFC](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/blob/master/rfcs/DeferStream.md)).

## `transfer-encoding: chunked`

The HTTP response for an incrementally delivered response should contain the `transfer-encoding: chunked` response header. Chunked transfer encoding allows the body of the response to be delivered as a series of chunks, allowing clients to read each chunk of the response as it is sent without waiting for the entire response.

## `content-type: multipart/mixed`

The HTTP response for an incrementally delivered response should conform to the [specification of multipart content defined by the W3 in rfc1341](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc1341/7_2_Multipart.html). The HTTP response must contain the `Content-Type` response header with a specified boundary, for example `content-type: multipart/mixed; boundary="-"`. Using a simple boundary of `-` works as there is no possiblity of conflict with JSON data. However, any boundary may be used.

An example response body will look like:

```
---
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 45

{"data":{"hello":"Hello Rob"},"hasNext":true}

---
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 57

{"data":{"test":"Hello World"},"path":[],"hasNext":false}

-----
```
* The boundary used is `-` and is passed to the client in the http response's content-type header. Note that headers can appear in both the HTTP response itself and as part of the response body. The content-type header must be sent in the HTTP response.
* Each part of the multipart response must start with `---` and a `CRLF`
* Each part of the multipart response must contain a `Content-Type` header. Similar to the GraphQL specification this specification does not require a specific serialization format. For consistency and ease of notation, examples of the response are given in JSON throughout the spec.
* Each part of the multipart response must contain a `Content-Length` header. This should be the number of bytes of the payload of the response. It does not include the size of the headers, boundaries, or `CRLF`s used to separate the content.
* After all headers, an additional `CRLF` is sent.
* The payload is sent, followed by two `CRLF`s.
* After the last part of the multipart response is sent, the terminating boundary `-----` is sent, followed by a `CRLF`

## Server Implementations
